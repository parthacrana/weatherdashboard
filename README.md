This is the readme file for the weather dashboard challenge! Week 4 challenge 6! 

This repo contains both the html, css(bootstrap) and the javascript files for the weather dashboard!

Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 

Had to code from scratch. Added bootstrap elements in place of css file. 

Google was used very less, so that is improvement. 

Still have to perfect fetch api urls and bootstrap mechanics.

7.10.2024: Practiced gitbash commands again, and incorporated fetch api in this challenge! 


Feedback is appreciated!
